# Introduction

A brief explanation what this project is all about.

## Ultimate frisbee

Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport played with a Frisbee disc. Usually 7 vs. 7 players compete on a field of the same length as a football field but half the width. The goal is for the team in posession of the disc to pass it into the opponent's end zone. The player holding the disc must not move and has to pass on within 10 seconds. The enemy team tries to intercept passes. For a more detailed explanation, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEKnqFBajiI) or refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)).

## HAT tournament

Ultimate knows several tournament modes. One really entertaining mode is called HAT. In this mode, you join a tournament as a single player. At the tournament, teams are made up from all players. Thus, at a HAT tournament you play for 2-3 days with many people you have never played with before. On such a tournament you get to know many new friends within little time, which is great fun. Also, you are typically forced to play in positions which you do not play in in you home team, which benefits your personal skill.

## The "MischMasch" HAT tournament

My home team "Disconnection" organizes the "MischMasch" HAT tournament. This tournament dates back to the 80s. Every year about 150 players compete in 12 teams for three days at the end of the summer. And every year we as hosting team are faced with the challenge to create evenly strong teams. Over the years, we have tried many new ideas how to assign the players to the teams. In the last years, this came down to a registration including a self-assessment by each player followed by a group of experts making up the teams.

## Project HATMaker

To faciliate the registration process, I created a website with database backend a few years ago and called it "HATMaker". Over the years, this came to include the self assessment data. When it came to the Udacity project on data visualization, I decided to enhance this project further and create a set of graphs which would ease the work for the persons assigning the players to the available teams, according to the result of the self assessments. The goal was to create a drag and drop table which can be used to change the assignment of players and to provide the user with visual clues about the skills of the indivudual players, as well as the combined strengths and weaknesses of each team.
